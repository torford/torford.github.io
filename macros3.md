## Customer Service Macros

**What are macros?** 

A macro is a pre-written response for customer-facing use, commonly used in help desk software services such as Zendesk or Salesforce. Macros save time, increase productivity, ensure accuracy, and reduce error. 

I help create and maintain a repository of over 300 macros for our Customer Care team. 

### 2. Coaching

**Scenario:** A new feature, Coaching, was released on the platform in June 2020. In order to prepaare the Customer Care team on how to respond to anticipated customer inquiries, I reviewed the new feature in-depth and crafted the following macros.

*Intake Options/Prospective Clients*

>When you first create your Coaching product, you’ll be able to choose how you want to intake clients.

>
>If you select to intake clients **Directly**, your students can go right to checkout from your sales page and can then get started on their first milestone.
>
>If you select to use an intake form, you can collect information about your clients prior to their checkout.
>
>You can edit the intake form questions via the **Intake Form** block on your Coaching sales page, as seen below:

>When using an intake form that *does not* require approval, your students will immediately be brought to your *Post Intake page* after they submit their answers to >the intake questions. You can add a *Pricing* block on your post intake page so that these users will be able to select their pricing option and complete checkout.
>
>When using an intake form that *does* require approval, your students will not be sent to checkout immediately. Instead, they will see a confirmation message that >their answers were submitted and they will be emailed if approved, as seen here:

>
>You’ll be able to review these prospective clients via the **Prospective** tab of the **Clients** page. If you want to approve a user so that they can checkout, >select the green checkmark icon.

These macros were prepared prior to feature launch day, so they were readily available once the feature was live.
